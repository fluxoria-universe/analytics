# Flux-sight Constitution

## Core Principles

### GraphQL Schema Design Excellence
All GraphQL APIs must follow schema-first development with clear, unambiguous type definitions. Queries must implement DataLoader pattern for N+1 query prevention. Schema evolution requires backward compatibility analysis. Type relationships must be explicitly defined with proper nullability constraints.

### Onchain Data Integrity and Real-time Synchronization
Onchain data handling must preserve immutability with Merkle tree validation for data integrity. Real-time synchronization requires WebSocket subscriptions with connection pooling. Blockchain state changes must trigger immediate cache invalidation. Historical data reconstruction must be supported through archival nodes.

### API Security and Access Control
All endpoints must implement JWT authentication with configurable role-based authorization. Input validation must use schema-based sanitization with rate limiting per API key. Security headers must include CSP, HSTS, and CORS policies. Audit logging must capture all authentication and authorization events.

### Performance Optimization and Scalability
Response times must not exceed 100ms p95 for GraphQL queries with Redis caching for hot data. Horizontal scaling must support load balancing with sticky sessions for subscriptions. Query result pagination must prevent memory exhaustion. Database connection pooling must be configured for high concurrency.

### Component Modularity and Reusability
All components must follow SOLID principles with dependency injection containers. Interface segregation must ensure clients depend only on required abstractions. Single responsibility principle requires one reason for change per class. Open-closed principle must enable extension without modification.

### Testing Discipline and Quality Assurance
Test-driven development is mandatory with failing tests written before implementation. Contract testing must validate GraphQL schema compliance. Integration tests must cover real-time subscriptions and security middleware. Code coverage must exceed 90% with performance regression testing.

## Technical Standards and Best Practices

### SOLID Principles Application
- **Single Responsibility**: Each service handles one domain concern (auth, caching, subscriptions)
- **Open-Closed**: Extension through new resolvers without modifying existing schema
- **Liskov Substitution**: Interface implementations must be fully interchangeable
- **Interface Segregation**: Separate interfaces for queries, mutations, and subscriptions
- **Dependency Inversion**: Business logic depends on abstractions, not concrete implementations

### Data Structures and Algorithms
- **Merkle Trees**: For blockchain data integrity validation and efficient state proofs
- **Bloom Filters**: For fast existence checks on large onchain datasets
- **Graph Structures**: For modeling complex blockchain entity relationships
- **LRU Caches**: For Redis-backed query result caching with TTL management
- **WebSocket Connection Pools**: For scalable real-time subscription handling

### Technology Stack Standards
- **GraphQL**: Apollo Server with schema stitching for modular APIs
- **Authentication**: JWT with RS256 signatures and refresh token rotation
- **Caching**: Redis Cluster with consistent hashing for horizontal scaling
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with TimescaleDB for time-series onchain data
- **Real-time**: Socket.io with Redis adapter for cross-server subscriptions

### Performance Benchmarks
- GraphQL query resolution: <50ms median, <100ms p95
- WebSocket subscription latency: <10ms for state changes
- Authentication overhead: <5ms per request
- Cache hit ratio: >95% for hot onchain data
- Memory usage: <512MB per service instance under load

### Security Standards
- API keys rotated quarterly with SHA-256 hashing
- Input validation using GraphQL schema constraints
- Rate limiting at 1000 requests per minute per API key
- Audit logs retained for 7 years with tamper-proof hashing
- Dependency vulnerability scanning in CI/CD pipeline

## Development Workflow and Code Quality

### Code Review Requirements
All pull requests require two approvals with mandatory security and performance reviews. Code must pass automated linting, testing, and security scanning. Architecture decisions must be documented with constitution principle justification. Performance benchmarks must be included for API changes.

### Testing Gates
- Unit tests must pass with >90% coverage before merge
- Integration tests must validate end-to-end GraphQL workflows
- Contract tests must verify API schema compliance
- Performance tests must prevent regression beyond 10% degradation
- Security tests must pass vulnerability scanning

### Quality Assurance Process
Code must follow TypeScript strict mode with no any types. Dependencies must be pinned with security advisories monitored. Documentation must be updated for API changes. Migration scripts must be provided for database schema changes.

### Deployment Approval Process
Production deployments require security review and performance validation. Rollback procedures must be documented with monitoring alerts. Feature flags must control new functionality with gradual rollout. Post-deployment monitoring must validate performance benchmarks.

### Continuous Integration
Automated pipelines must run on every commit with parallel test execution. Docker containers must be built for each service with security scanning. Performance regression testing must run against staging environment. Deployment must be automated with blue-green strategy.

## Governance

Constitution supersedes all other practices and guides all technical decisions. Amendments require documented justification with impact analysis on existing principles. Version follows semantic versioning with major changes requiring unanimous approval. Compliance reviews occur quarterly with automated monitoring. Architecture decisions must cite relevant principles with rationale for any deviations.
